<section level="#" label="isotopes">Isotope List</section>

The table listed in this Appendix is generated with the following
code, listing all six properties of CDK atom types, as outlined
in Section <xref>cdkatomtype</xref>. Abundances and exact masses are
inherited from the BODR project, which contains
values extracted from IUPAC recommendations.

<code>ListAllIsotopes</code>

The full version of the above script lists all (natural) isotopes
with an abundance of more than 0.1:
